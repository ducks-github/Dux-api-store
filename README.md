# Dux API Store

## Goal
The Dux API Store is a decentralized marketplace integrated into Dux OS, designed to allow developers to publish and monetize APIs and applications using Flopcoin as the payment currency. Its primary goal is to create an accessible, secure platform where users can discover, use, and pay for computational services (e.g., data processing, image upscaling, or custom apps) while providers earn Flopcoin for their contributions.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Marketplace**: Publishes APIs/apps via a distributed registry (e.g., IPFS or DHT) for global access.
- **Flopcoin Payments**: Charges users Flopcoin per API/app use, with 95% to providers and 5% to a community fund.
- **Secure Execution**: Runs APIs/apps in sandboxed environments to prevent malicious code execution.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a local GUI for browsing, searching, and filtering services by tags, price, or ratings.
- **Transparency**: Logs all transactions and provides reputation scoring for providers to ensure trust.

## Purpose
The Dux API Store aims to democratize access to computational services by enabling developers to monetize their work and users to access diverse tools seamlessly. It transforms Dux OS into a vibrant ecosystem for decentralized software and services, with Flopcoin facilitating secure, automated payments.

## Getting Started
- Install Dux OS and access the API Store via the Dux OS Wallet GUI.
- Developers: Register APIs/apps using the Dux Store dashboard, setting metadata and Flopcoin pricing.
- Users: Browse and call services directly from the GUI, with payments handled automatically via Flopcoin wallets.
- See the [Dux OS Documentation](link-to-docs) for detailed instructions.
